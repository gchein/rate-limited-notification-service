# Rate-Limited Notification Service Workflow

## Initial Approach

- [x] **Define the Schema**

- [x] **Create the Models**

- [ ] **Define the Routes and Corresponding Controller Actions**

- [ ] **Define how the Notification Service will be implemented (scopes / ActiveRecord Query with #count / other)**

- [ ] **Implement the rule-setting system that will be consumed by the Notification Service (YAML file / Rules Hash Constant / Rule Dynamic Model)**

- [ ] **Create the Service Respecting the Rules**

- [ ] **Refactor as Applicable and Retest Application Functionality**

- [ ] **Add to README**
  - [ ] Implicit assumptions and definitions.
  - [ ] Guide for running and testing the application.
  - [ ] Additional notes or instructions.
